<h1 style="font-size:200%;color:white">Hello all, My name is Fares Alhaqbani</h1>
<p1 style="font-size:120%;color:white">This is my first attempt in writing a blog. I love travelling. I have always been passionate about travelling ever since I was a child. I would like to travel the world and create a professional blog someday. So, I have started my travel journey from USA. I eagerly wait for long weekends to pack my bagpack and go out to explore places. I would like to take this platform to share the places I have visited and loved so far with you all. </p1>

<h2 style="font-size:200%;color:white"> Yosemite National Park</h2>
<p2 style="font-size:120%;color:white"> Located in the California’s Sierra Nevada mountains. One could say this place is hikers paradise as there are over 800 miles of trails including everything from an easy stroll to a challenging mountain hike, or an overnight backpack trip. The best times to visit Yosemite are May and September, when the park is accessible but not too crowded. It's important to know that many roads and trails in Yosemite are closed for the majority of the year due to snow. It is the home to soaring granite icons such as Half Dome, El Capitan and Yosemite Falls, and some of the world's biggest and oldest trees, the giant sequoias, as well as a wide range of natural monuments, vineyards, and historic Gold Rush landmarks.</p2>

<h3 style="font-size:200%;color:white">Chicago</h3>
<p3 style="font-size:120%;color:white">Chicago is the city which has the Skydeck,one of the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. At 1,353 feet in the air, the Ledge’s glass boxes extend out 4.3 feet from the Skydeck. You can enjoy the panoramic view of four states from this building. This is one of the most unique experience I have had. In addition to the Skydeck, I enjoyed visiting the Millenium Park, and Navy Pier as well. One this that is confusing is the Chicago Downtown. I took me a while to figure out that place though.</p3>
